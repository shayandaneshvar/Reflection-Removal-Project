# Reflection-Removal-Project
Bachelor's Degree Final Project
## Abstract
In recent years, we have observed many advancements in the fields of Computer Vision and 
Image Processing, and consequently, self-driving vehicles. One of the main responsibilities of 
self-driving vehicles is to be able to detect objects correctly and quickly, which has become 
very easy to achieve due to the emergence of neural networks. However, there is a fundamental 
problem regarding the cameras that are being used in such vehicles, which is being placed 
behind the windshield. This causes unwanted reflections of in-vehicle objects on the 
windshield, which heavily degrades the quality of captured images, and consequently leads to 
poor performance of the object detection system, due to being trained with images captured in 
an ideal environment with no reflection or dirt. Thus, there is an inevitable need for a reflection 
removal system that removes the reflection or at least decreases its effect. 
In this thesis, we use a dataset to create images that contain reflections, then we train two U-Net based neural networks with it and achieve an accuracy of over 71 percent in each one of 
them. At the end, we compare the two models and reach a conclusion, and some notes on how 
to improve the models and build a better model.
